Title: Built 4 CLI tools that automated my entire productivity system

I've been working on my personal AI assistant for 2 weeks and just published everything as open source.

**What it does:**

1. **Smart Reminders Analyzer** - Cleans up Apple Reminders using AI (categorizes vague/duplicate items)

2. **Meeting Prep Assistant** - Generates meeting briefs by pulling calendar events and searching related emails

3. **Knowledge Sync** - Syncs books/audiobooks to Obsidian for better retention

4. **Podcast Notes** - Converts YouTube/podcasts into searchable Obsidian notes with AI transcription + summary

**Why CLI?**
- Fast (no UI overhead)
- Composable (pipe between tools)
- Cron-friendly (automate everything)
- Self-hosted (your data stays yours)

**Tech stack:** Node.js, AppleScript, MiniMax API, Whisper CLI, Obsidian

All 4 skills are published here:

Happy to answer questions about the architecture or how to contribute!
