### Tweet 1 (Hook)
🧵 I built 4 CLI productivity tools in 2 weeks. They save me 3+ hours every week.

No more:
❌ 683 scattered reminders
❌ 15min meeting prep
❌ Lost podcast insights

Here's how I automated my digital chaos 👇

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
It started with a hard truth: I had 683 Apple Reminders.

Most were outdated. I'd scroll past them daily, feeling guilty, never cleaning up.

I tried apps. They were too complex. Too expensive.

So I built my own.

### Tweet 3 (The Solution - Smart Reminders)
1️⃣ Smart Reminders Analyzer 🧠
```bash
$ smart-reminders analyze
→ 683 reminders analyzed
→ 119 Clear, 2 Unclear, 1 Duplicate
→ Recommendation: Archive 561 obsolete
```

Reduces active reminders by 80% in one run.

### Tweet 4 (The Solution - More Skills)
2️⃣ Meeting Prep Assistant 📅
→ 15min → 2min prep time
→ Auto-gathers emails, context, AI summary

3️⃣ Knowledge Sync 📚
→ Audible/Kindle → Obsidian
→ All highlights searchable

4️⃣ Podcast → Notes 🎧
→ YouTube → AI summary + auto-tags

### Tweet 5 (CTA + Value)
All 4 skills are open source. Free. Built for macOS.

They save me 3+ hours/week. Compound effect = real productivity wins.

🚀 I Built 4 Productivity Tools in 2 Weeks (And Saved 3+ Hours/Week)

Here's the story:

I was drowning in digital clutter:
• 683 Apple Reminders (most irrelevant)
• 15 minutes per meeting just to prep
• Podcast insights I couldn't recall
• Book highlights scattered everywhere

I tried existing solutions. They were either:
- Too complex for what I needed
- Too expensive for simple tasks
- Not integrated with my workflow

So I built my own.

## The 4 Skills

🔹 **Smart Reminders Analyzer** - AI categorizes 683 reminders, suggests what to archive. Reduced my active reminders by 80%.

🔹 **Meeting Prep Assistant** - Auto-generates briefings with context from emails and calendar. Prep time: 15min → 2min.

🔹 **Knowledge Sync** - Captures Audible/Kindle insights to Obsidian. Weekly review system included.

🔹 **Podcast → Notes** - YouTube URL → AI summary with auto-tagging. Zero-friction capture.

## Why CLI?

I chose command-line tools because:
- Faster to build
- More automatable
- Composability (pipe tools together)
- Respects my existing workflow

## The Real Win

It's not about the tools. It's about reclaiming cognitive bandwidth.

When mundane tasks are automated, you focus on what matters: creative work, strategic thinking, meaningful conversations.

**Time saved:** 3+ hours/week
**Mental overhead:** Significantly reduced
**Satisfaction:** Building solutions that fit my exact needs

## Try It Yourself

All 4 skills are open source:
🔗 github.com/Melflin/melflin-oss

Requirements: macOS, Node.js, your own API keys.

If you've been thinking about building your own productivity tools—do it. The satisfaction of using something you created yourself is unmatched.
