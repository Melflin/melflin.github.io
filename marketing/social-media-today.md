**Built 4 AI-powered productivity tools in 2 weeks — here's what I learned**

Last week I decided to build something ambitious: 4 CLI skills that automate busywork using local AI tools.

The result?
✅ Smart Reminders Analyzer
✅ Meeting Prep Assistant  
✅ Knowledge Sync
✅ Podcast → Notes

Key learnings:
1. Dogfooding matters — I use everything I build
2. Local-first > Cloud-first for privacy
3. Documentation is as important as code
4. Community feedback accelerates iteration

All open source (MIT): https://github.com/Melflin/melflin-oss

Would love feedback from the productivity/automation community! 🚀

**Built 4 CLI tools to automate my productivity workflow (2 weeks, open source)**

Hey r/productivity 👋

Spent the last 2 weeks building CLI skills that actually solve my daily pain points:

1. 🧠 Smart Reminders Analyzer — AI cleans up cluttered reminder lists
2. 📅 Meeting Prep Assistant — Auto-generates briefings 2h before meetings
3. 🔄 Knowledge Sync — Syncs highlights from Kindle/Audible to Obsidian
4. 🎧 Podcast → Notes — Transcribes podcasts + generates AI summaries

All tools are:
- Local-first (no cloud subscriptions)
- Privacy-focused (data stays on your machine)
- Fully documented with demos
- MIT licensed

Would love feedback from the community! What productivity tools are you using? 🎯
