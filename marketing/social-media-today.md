**4 CLI Skills in 14 Days: Building with Autonomous AI Agents**

Last week, I tasked an autonomous AI agent to build productivity tools — and it delivered 4 fully functional skills.

The experiment proved something important:
→ AI agents can go from idea → production code
→ Local-first tools have real utility
→ Automation compounds over time

Each skill solves a specific pain point I face daily. They're not prototypes — they're tools I actually use.

All open source: https://github.com/Melflin/melflin-oss
