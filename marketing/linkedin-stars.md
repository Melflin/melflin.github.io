**Draft:**

After 15 years in IT, I finally built my own personal AI assistant.

Not a SaaS subscription. Not another chat UI. Just 4 CLI tools that live on my Mac and do the boring stuff for me:

📌 Smart Reminders - AI cleans up my cluttered reminder list
📌 Meeting Prep - Auto-generated briefings from calendar + email context
📌 Knowledge Sync - My books & podcasts automatically appear in Obsidian
📌 Podcast Notes - YouTube/Podcast → Transcription → AI Summary → Note

All open source, all self-hosted, all built in 2 weeks.

If you love automation and want your own digital assistant, check out the repo:

Happy to chat about the architecture or how to extend it!
