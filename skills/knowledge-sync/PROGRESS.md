## 🔍 Research Results (Jan 18)

### Stefan's Tool Usage Confirmed:
| Tool | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Audible | ✅ YES | Extensive library, CHF 15/month, mentioned 5+ times |
| Obsidian | ✅ YES | Vault `Melf2025` with `Zitate` folder |
| Readwise | ❓ UNKNOWN | Mentioned in goals, no usage evidence |
| Kindle | ❓ UNKNOWN | No `My Clippings.txt` found |
| Pocket/Instapaper | ❓ UNKNOWN | Not found |

### Key Insight:
> Stefan listens to audiobooks but has no systematic highlight collection. Only 2 quote files in Obsidian `Zitate` folder (from 2025).

### Strategy Shift:
1. **Skip API integrations** (Readwise/Kindle) for MVP - Stefan doesn't seem to use them
2. **Build Manual Workflow** - Simple template + reminder system for Audible books
3. **Obsidian-native** - No external sync, just better process
